bcCMS
=====

Very simple CMS with a focus on making it easy for designers to manipulate the layout.

I designed this CMS as an attempt to expand my PHP knowledge, drawing some elements of Wordpress - but simplified to the point the user could essentially build their own CSS template around the basic functions.
